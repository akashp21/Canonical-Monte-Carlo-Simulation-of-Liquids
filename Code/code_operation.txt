Code Operation
1. Run Cell 1 and cell 2
2. Adjust initial parameters : n_atoms, T, rho, type2atoms(for V2), a, b, c, d, runs
   In line 30 in V1 (line 34 for V2), change how_to_initialize = “___” to your desired initialization parameters

	“lattice”
	Starting point. Generates lattice for simulation.

	“equilibrating”
	Resets trajectory at the last frame in the previous run, maintains the value of the maximum change in distance of the atoms. Used for equilibrating your simulation.

	“restart”
	Extend your trajectory file for more data.

3. Run cell 3 to start simulation

4. Run cell 4 to start analysis

5. Run cell 5 for thermodynamic quantities and averages+variance

6. Run cell 6 for pressure graph

7. Run cell 7 for potential energy graph

8. Run cell 8 for translational order parameter graph

9. Run cell 9 for radial distribution graph
