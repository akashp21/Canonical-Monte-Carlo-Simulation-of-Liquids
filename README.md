For our project, we decided to delve into the self-assembly of particles in a liquid. Our goal was to simulate stable, self-assembled states of a 
two-particle system using the Monte Carlo method and the Metropolis method as a propagation mechanism. The Metropolis Monte Carlo method generates 
trajectories in phase space that then samples from a chosen statistical ensemble. As for our computations, we have decided to sample from the canonical 
ensemble, where the number of atoms, the temperature and the volume are held constant. Further, in our system, the atom interactions are based off of the 
Lennard-Jones potential. Though, to make matters far simpler, we decided to use the reduced units.
